            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Akhil. I'm a computer engineering student with a passion for <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">signals and systems</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">digital hardware design</abbr>, and all things related to computer architecture and ciruits. 
                I've been diving deep into projects that range from smart glasses powered by an ESP32 to AI-powered squirrel detection systems (yes, really). 
                I’ve even tinkered with VU meters, Twitch game shows, and everything in between.
            </p>
            <p>When I’m not knee-deep in circuit boards and code, I love immersing myself in stories—whether through books, games, or art. 
                I’m an avid reader, especially drawn to horror and dark fantasy. 
                I’m a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson’s works, with Yumi and the Nightmare Painter holding a special place for how it resonated with me during a challenging time. 
                I’ve also fallen down literary rabbit holes with books like The Three-Body Problem and The Handmaid’s Tale. 
                If you’re curious about my thoughts on these, feel free to check out my reviews on Goodreads.</p>
                <p>Video games are another big part of my life. 
                    I enjoy the competitive thrill of League of Legends and the immersive worlds of RPGs, where storytelling and strategy collide. 
                    Lately, I’ve been exploring the art of modding game consoles and games—it’s like giving new life to old favorites. 
                    Speaking of art, I’ve recently developed an interest in art history, inspired by my love for creating art in my free time. 
                    It’s fascinating to see how art has evolved and how it continues to influence modern design.</p>
                    <p>
                        At home, I’ve got a soldering station where I work on PCB designs and personal projects—it’s my creative playground. 
                        I also have a soft spot for cool, unique gadgets that add character to my room and personal space. 
                        And, as if that’s not enough, I’ve been dipping my toes into the world of brewing and bartending, with dreams of crafting my own mead someday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that being said, welcome to my little corner of the web! Here, you’ll find my projects, notes, and thoughts on everything from transistors to the latest sci-fi rabbit hole I’ve fallen into. 
                        Check out the projects page to see what I’ve been building, or reach out if you want to chat about tech, books, or even squirrels.
